# MapToolIntegration
Experiemental Repository for testing Github integration from MapTool.

## Design notes
- A drop-in library that enables integration with Github through the use of the REST functions. 
- Requires the REST methods be unlocked in MapTool
- Will require an existing repository. 
- Will require an OAuth token from Github.
- Must be fairly simple to setup with a dialog for storing the necessary values
  - Repository
  - Owner
  - Token
- Dialog for selecting items to store in repo. 
  - Initial goal will be campaign macros and library macros.
